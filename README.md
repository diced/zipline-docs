# Zipline docs v3

Documentation for [Zipline](https://github.com/diced/zipline)!

## Contributing

**Do not make** PRs to the `prod` branch, your PR will get closed. Instead, make PRs to the `trunk` branch, which will be merged into `prod` when the next Zipline release is made, or whenever I want to. By default, PRs will be made to the `trunk` branch as it's the default branch.
