# S3
Configuration for the `s3` datasource. In theory, when setup with the correct options, any S3 compatible storage should work with Zipline.

## `DATASOURCE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
The access key id for your Amazon AWS account, or if using a different S3 provider they will usually provide these details.
```bash
DATASOURCE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=changethis
```

## `DATASOURCE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
The secret access key for your Amazon AWS account, or if using a different S3 provider they will usually provide these details.
```bash
DATASOURCE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=changethis
```

## `DATASOURCE_S3_ENDPOINT`
The endpoint for your S3 region, if your S3 bucket was created in `us-west-2`, then the endpoint would look like `s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`, etc. If using a different S3 provider they will usually provide these details.
```bash
DATASOURCE_S3_ENDPOINT=s3.amazonaws.com
```

## `DATASOURCE_S3_PORT`
The port for your S3 source, if you want to connect to your locally hosted S3 (Example: Local Minio instance)
```bash
DATASOURCE_S3_PORT=9000
```

## `DATASOURCE_S3_BUCKET`
The name of the bucket to save files to.
```bash
DATASOURCE_S3_BUCKET=changethis
```

## `DATASOURCE_S3_FORCE_S3_PATH`
Whether or not to force the path to be `s3://bucket/path/to/file`.
```bash
DATASOURCE_S3_FORCE_S3_PATH=false
```

## `DATASOURCE_S3_REGION`
The region to connect to the S3 bucket, if using a custom S3 provider they might use the default `us-east-1` region so you can leave this field as is, or if they use a different region you can set it here.
```bash
DATASOURCE_S3_REGION=us-east-1
```
